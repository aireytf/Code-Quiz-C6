# Code-Quiz-C6

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 6 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp.

I was to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The quiz was to contain the following requirements:

1) A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
- Questions contain buttons for each answer.
- When answer is clicked, the next question appears
- If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock

2) The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
- When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score

The following pictures show the layout and functionality of my finished application (which appropriately resembles the Demo animation provided):
